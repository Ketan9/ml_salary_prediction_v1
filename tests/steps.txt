first of all clone the git repository 
>> git clone https://github.com/Ketan9/ml_salary_prediction_v1.git

go into the folder. and follow with me.

Go to the folder and open powershell from there

1. create the virtual environment
$ pip install virtualenv
OR
$ virtualenv <myvenv_name>

2. activate virtual environment
Run this in powershell >>  .\myvenv\Scripts\activate.ps1

3. create requirements.txt file
$ pip freeze > requirements.txt

4. Edit the requirements.txt file and add all the required package for your project and run below command next to install the packages.
$ pip install -r .\requirements.txt

5. create src dirrectory and go to src directory
$ mkdir src
$ cd src

Add model.pkl, app.py
Optional: Add model.py, hiring.csv,

6. create tests dirrectory and go to src directory: create a new python file to writing a unit test to see if index function is working properly or not.
$ mkdir tests
$ cd tests

>>go to main folder
run 
$ pytest
--this will throw an error, because "test" package does not know what is "app"

--I have removed the pytest from the github actions workflow as I am getting errors with the paths. I will look into this later

Once the CI part is working, we use heroku for deployment.
download/install heroku CLI

login to heroku using CLI
$  heroku login
this will open browser...enter your username and password to generate heroku CLI session

create an application on heroku
heroku create 
OR
heroku apps:create smart-panda

git push heroku master
it can push my flask code to heroku's remote repository, which is available on their server. 
we do not want to push the code manually on heroku, that's why we will add this in part of the workflow.

Ubuntu machine on github needs to login to know the heroku server.
we will provide API token in github, so that it can login to heroku server.
$heroku authorizations:create
This creates an authorization with access to Heroku account. this will create Long-lived user authorization token.
my github repo is public so we need to add this token to github secrets.
