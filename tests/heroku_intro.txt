Heroku
Parent organization: Salesforce
Heroku is a container-based cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS). used to  to deploy, manage, and scale modern apps
Heroku is a cloud platform that lets companies build, deliver, monitor and scale apps â€” we're the fastest way to go from idea to URL, bypassing all those infrastructure headaches.
Heroku is the quickest way for a company to become an apps company. Heroku is a service that enables companies to spend their time developing and deploying apps that immediately start producing value.



--Heroku CLI

heroku login
heroku logs --app <app_name>


--I have removed the pytest from the github actions workflow as I am getting errors with the paths. I will look into this later

Once the CI part is working, we use heroku for deployment.
download/install heroku CLI

login to heroku using CLI
$  heroku login
this will open browser...enter your username and password to generate heroku CLI session

create an application on heroku
heroku create 
OR
heroku apps:create smart-panda

git push heroku master
it can push my flask code to heroku's remote repository, which is available on their server. 
we do not want to push the code manually on heroku, that's why we will add this in part of the workflow.

Ubuntu machine on github needs to login to know the heroku server.
we will provide API token in github, so that it can login to heroku server.
$heroku authorizations:create
This creates an authorization with access to Heroku account. this will create Long-lived user authorization token.
my github repo is public so we need to add this token to github secrets.
